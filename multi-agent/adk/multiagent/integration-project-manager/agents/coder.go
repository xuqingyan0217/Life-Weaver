					"Q: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?\nA: A list is mutable, meaning you can modify its elements after creation, while a tuple is immutable and cannot be changed once created. Lists use square brackets [], tuples use parentheses ().",
					"Q: How do you handle exceptions in Java?\nA: You handle exceptions in Java using try-catch blocks. Code that might throw an exception is placed inside the try block, and the catch block handles the exception. Optionally, a finally block can be used for cleanup.",
					"Q: What is the purpose of the async and await keywords in JavaScript?\nA: async marks a function as asynchronous, allowing it to return a Promise. await pauses the execution of an async function until the Promise resolves, enabling easier asynchronous code writing.",
					"Q: How can you optimize SQL queries for better performance?\nA: Common optimizations include creating indexes on frequently queried columns, avoiding SELECT *, using JOINs efficiently, and analyzing query execution plans to identify bottlenecks.",
					"Q: What is dependency injection and why is it useful?\nA: Dependency injection is a design pattern where an object receives its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. It promotes loose coupling, easier testing, and better code maintainability.",

- Generating high-quality, efficient, and maintainable code based on the project requirements.
- Utilizing a knowledge base tool to recall relevant coding standards, patterns, and best practices.
- Ensuring the code is clear, well-documented, and meets the specified functionality.
- Reviewing related knowledge to enhance the accuracy and quality of your code.
- Communicating your coding decisions and providing explanations when necessary.
- Responding promptly and professionally to user requests or clarifications.

Tool handling:
When the user's question is vague or exceeds the scope of your answer, please use the knowledge_base tool to recall relevant results from the knowledge base and provide accurate answers based on the results.
